# AlstraBridge: A Decentralized Multi-Chain Bridge

## Overview

AlstraBridge is a decentralized network designed to facilitate secure, bidirectional asset transfers and data exchange between multiple external blockchains and a custom Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain. The bridge acts as the central communication hub, ensuring the accuracy, privacy, and integrity of data as it flows between chains.

## Key Components

- **External Blockchains**: Multiple external blockchains that supply data to the bridge.
- **Validators**: A network of validators responsible for ensuring the correctness and integrity of the data.
- **BFT-based PoS Consensus**: Validators use a Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based Proof of Stake (BFT-based PoS) consensus mechanism to agree on data validity.
- **Block Data Structure**:
   - **Header Information**: Includes metadata such as block number, timestamp, and previous block hash.
   - **Transaction Data**: Contains transaction details, sender and recipient addresses, and digital signatures.
   - **Merkle Root**: The root hash of a Merkle tree for efficient proof validation.
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Ensures data privacy, correctness, and integrity.

## Data Flow

### External Data Reception

- The bridge receives data from multiple external blockchains, including transaction details, Merkle proofs, and ZKPs.

### Data Validation and Consensus

- Validators within the bridge network validate the incoming data for correctness and integrity.
- They participate in a BFT-based PoS consensus mechanism to reach an agreement on data validity.

### Consensus Process

- The BFT-based PoS consensus process involves validators proposing and agreeing on data validity.
- Validators generate consensus proofs to demonstrate that they collectively agree on data correctness and integrity.

### Proving Merkle Proof Correctness

- Validators generate a proof that the Merkle proof for the transactions within a block is indeed correct.
- This proof demonstrates the integrity of the Merkle proof without revealing specific transaction details.

### Proving Consensus on Merkle Proof Correctness

- Following Merkle proof validation, validators collectively generate a proof that consensus was reached on the validity of the Merkle proof.
- This proof confirms that the validators unanimously agree on the Merkle proof's validity.

### Supplying Data and Proofs to State Tracking Smart Contracts

- The validated data, Merkle proofs, proof of Merkle proofs, and consensus proofs are supplied to the state tracking smart contracts on the Ethereum custom chain.
- Smart contracts act as verifiers, using ZKPs to confirm data correctness, Merkle proof accuracy, and consensus on both data and Merkle proof validity.

### State Update and Synchronization

- The state tracking smart contracts update the state of external blockchains on the Ethereum custom chain based on the validated data.
- This ensures synchronization and consistency between external blockchains and the custom EVM chain.

## Security and Privacy

- The combination of Merkle trees, ZKPs, BFT-based PoS consensus, and selective disclosure guarantees data integrity and privacy.
- Users can independently verify their transactions and data correctness without relying on centralized authorities.

## Benefits

- Enhanced data integrity and privacy in multi-chain interoperability and state tracking.
- Efficient and trustworthy data validation.
- Secure cross-chain asset transfers.
- Synchronized and consistent state tracking.
